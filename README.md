# EDA on One-Max
Simple Implementation of Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) on one-max problem

## What are EDAs?
Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), sometimes called probabilistic model-building genetic algorithms (PMBGAs), are stochastic optimization methods that guide the search for the optimum by building and sampling explicit probabilistic models of promising candidate solutions. Optimization is viewed as a series of incremental updates of a probabilistic model, starting with the model encoding an uninformative prior over admissible solutions and ending with the model that generates only the global optima. (from Wikipedia)

## What is One-Max?
The OneMax Problem or BitCounting is a simple problem consisting in maximizing the number of ones of a bitstring.

## Executing program
You can run the [notebook on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SgyS9rQmSTo06sGy8g5D2F1c4QKD2eSn?usp=sharing).
